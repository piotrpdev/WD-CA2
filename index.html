            Rosslare, also known as Rosslare Strand, has been a tourist resort
            for at least 100 years. It is noted as the "sunniest spot in
            Ireland", and records bear this out: Rosslare receives 300 hours
            more sunshine each year than the average place in Ireland. The long
            sandy strand is a Blue Flag beach. The beach itself consists of sand
            and stone running the length of the southern peninsula which
            protrudes into Wexford Harbour. It is segmented by a series of
            timber breakwaters which are designed to retain sandy deposits along
            the beach.

            Rosslare Strand supports a wealth of wildlife, habitats and natural
            amenities. The village’s most significant natural heritage amenities
            are mudflats and sandflats and the internationally important
            population of wintering waterbirds that can regularly be seen
            feeding on these flats close to Burrow Road and Rosslare Point.
            Other notable wildlife interests and amenities of the area include:

            Rosslare Tidy Towns is a voluntary organisation set up to help with
            the upkeep of Rosslare. The primary focus of TidyTowns is to
            encourage communities to improve their local environment and make
            their area a better place to live, work and visit. We meet every
            Wednesday @ 10:30am in Cois Barry Community Centre.
          </p>

          <p>
            The national TidyTowns initiative was launched in 1958 by Bord
            Fáilte (now Fáilte Ireland). It was originally part of ‘Tostal’, a
            nationwide festival celebrating all things Irish. A step-up from the
            original National Spring Clean Campaign, which ran between 1953 and
            1957, TidyTowns rapidly developed its own identity and has gone on
            to become Ireland’s most well known and popular local environmental
            initiative.

            If you would like to volunteer, first of all you should try to
            contact your local TidyTowns Group directly. Please see below the
            links to individual TidyTowns’ websites and Facebook pages. If you
            see volunteers working locally, maybe ask them about joining, or ask
            in your local shop or a business? or Volunteer via www.volunteer.ie,
            since the Volunteer Ireland website has many TidyTowns committees
            registered. or Furthermore, you can contact the TidyTowns Unit by
            e-mailing tidytowns@drcd.gov.ie or Finally, if there is a local
            TidyTowns committee already in place, we will be delighted to
            contact them on your behalf.
