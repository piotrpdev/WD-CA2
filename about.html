                Rosslare Tidy Towns is a voluntary organisation set up to help
                with the upkeep of Rosslare. The primary focus of TidyTowns is
                to encourage communities to improve their local environment and
                make their area a better place to live, work and visit. We meet
                every Wednesday @ 10:30am in Cois Barry Community Centre.

                The national TidyTowns initiative was launched in 1958 by Bord
                Fáilte (now Fáilte Ireland). It was originally part of ‘Tostal’,
                a nationwide festival celebrating all things Irish. A step-up
                from the original National Spring Clean Campaign, which ran
                between 1953 and 1957, TidyTowns rapidly developed its own
                identity and has gone on to become Ireland’s most well known and
                popular local environmental initiative.

          <h2><i>Tell me more about TidyTowns!</i></h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              SuperValu TidyTowns has always been about the National
              Competition. However, the sprit of TidyTowns has permeated Irish
              society far deeper than that. Many people today are not even aware
              that TidyTowns was originally linked to a single competition
              organised for 37 years. First of all by Bord Fáilte, then the
              Irish Tourist Board, and now by the Department of Rural and
              Community Development.
            </p>

            <p>
              The reasons for this are many, but a major factor was the success
              of the National Competition from the 1950s onwards. This
              encouraged many other bodies, notably local authorities and
              communities themselves, to organise their own initiatives under
              the TidyTowns banner consequently spreading the message far and
              wide. Hundreds of thousands of people have participated in local
              initiatives of every shape and size over the last fifty years.
              Their input has made a massive contribution to making TidyTowns
              the national movement that it is today. Year on Year the
              competition is thriving with committee entries increasing and
              exceeding over 800 for the last 3 years.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many of these local initiatives are still going strong, some with
              a new title and different focus. Their ongoing success is a
              constant reminder that TidyTowns means far more than just the
              national competition. It is a spirit alive and well in all those
              initiatives and those who participate in them. Thousands of
              individuals and organisations who every day take some action,
              large or small, to improve their local environment.
